# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official email address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
joe_mazzone@uri.edu.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Decisons 

Decisions of the group will be made in a consensus so there can be common agreement. 

## Attendance

Attendance for all team meetings are required unless there is a valid reason why. 
If you will not be present for a meeting, ensure that the SCRUM master knows 24 hours in 
advance before the meeting, unless it is emergency. 
Examples of valid reasons for missing a meeting include:

  -Illness/Injury
  -Family Emergency 
  -Religious Observance
  -Technical Difficulties (If meeting remote)

If a mamber of the group misses a meeting, meet with the SCRUM master and ensure they get informed of 
what they missed. 

## Assignments

We will ensure that members of the group get an even amount of work to do for the project. 
Members who do not complete their part or do it poorly will be asked to do it again. If 
the issue presists, the instructors will be notified. 

## Participation

We will be communcating our information through various platforms. Participation will be ensured so that
regarding every task for a sprint, everyone will do an even amount of work in some capacity. Members will
be assigned tasks based on their skills and interests of the task at hand. 

## Meeting Times and Locations/Mediums

We will coordinate ahead of time whether the meeting will be in person or online. 
We want to accomodate for all of the members schedules and come to a consensus for 
meeting times. 
### During all team meetings phones are not to be used as a distraction at any point in time

## Agenda and Minutes/Notes

Notes for the project will be taken via a shared Google Doc which all members have access to. 

## Promptness 

Excessive lateness will not be tolerated. If you are going to be late, ensure the SCRUM master knows 
before the meeting starts 

## Conversational Courtesies 

During meetings, all members should be courtious and respectful of other members ideas. We  encourage to have 
all members ideas brought to light with no disrepsect towards them. 

## Enforcement/Feedback

The team will enforce its own rules by being diligent in regards to the project material and will ensure 
they follow the guidelines. Give feedback as necessary which benefits the member and enourages them to improve
when necessary.
