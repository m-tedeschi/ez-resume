# A/B Test 1: Increase Resume Completion Rate
  User Story 4

  Metric: Net Promoter Score to see how smooth and engaging our UI is 

  ## Hypothesis
  Many users begin the resume creation process in the EZ Resume App but do not complete it, resulting in a low conversion rate for completed resume downloads. Based on          user feedback and tracking data, we observed that most drop-offs occur after users select a template and before they reach the final “Download” step. This suggests users     may be overwhelmed by the interface or unclear about how close they are to finishing. This low completion rate impacts the app's effectiveness and the perceived value to     users, who may feel frustrated or uncertain about the process. Increasing resume download completion will enhance user satisfaction and demonstrate the app’s value by      helping users complete the intended task more efficiently.

  ## Experiment
  We will allocate 50% of our user base to the experiment, with 25% in the control group (existing layout) and 25% in the treatment group (step-by-step layout with progress    indicator). This split ensures we maintain a sufficiently large control group while still gathering meaningful insights on user behavior in the treatment group. A 50/50      split ensures statistical significance, providing a clear comparison of user behavior between the two groups without compromising user experience.

  Firebase Capabilities Utilized
  Firebase Remote Config: This will be used to toggle between the control and treatment group interfaces in real-time, making it easy to deploy the A/B test without            requiring a new app version release.
  
  Firebase A/B Testing: Leverages Firebase’s built-in capabilities to manage and track the experiment, ensuring that variations are tested accurately and results are           presented in a statistically valid format.
  
  Firebase Analytics: Used to track user engagement and completion metrics, allowing us to determine the impact of the experiment on user behavior.

  ## Variation
  Variation 1: Control (Existing Design)
  Design: The current design displays all form fields in a single, scrollable page format, with no progress indicator.
  CTA Placement: The "Download Resume" button is placed at the end of the form, which users can only see once they complete all fields.
  Potential Issues: Users may feel overwhelmed by the number of fields presented at once and may abandon the process due to a lack of feedback on their progress.


# A/B Test 2: Simplify Account Creation to Boost Signup Completion
User Story 1

Metric: Adoption rate to track the number of users who complete the account creation process.

## Hypothesis

Many users begin the account creation process but do not complete it, leading to lower user adoption. Tracking data shows that users often drop off when asked to fill in multiple fields on a single page. This suggests that presenting all required information at once might be overwhelming or time-consuming. By breaking the account creation process into a two-step flow, we hypothesize that users will feel less burdened and be more likely to complete their signup. Improving the signup completion rate will increase user adoption, allowing more users to access and benefit from the app.

## Experiment

We will allocate 50% of our new user base to the experiment, with 25% in the control group (single-page layout) and 25% in the treatment group (two-step layout). This even split will allow us to gather clear insights while maintaining enough users in each group to achieve statistical significance.

Firebase Capabilities Utilized

Firebase Remote Config: Allows us to toggle between the control and treatment interfaces in real-time, facilitating a seamless A/B test without requiring a new app version release.
Firebase A/B Testing: Provides Firebase’s built-in functionality to manage and analyze the experiment, ensuring accurate results.
Firebase Analytics: Tracks user engagement and completion rates for each signup variation, helping us assess the effectiveness of the experiment.
Variation

## Variation

Variation 1: Control (Single-Page Layout)
Design: Users see all required fields (e.g., email, password, profile setup) on one scrollable page.
CTA Placement: The "Create Account" button appears at the bottom, only accessible once all fields are completed.
Potential Issues: Users may feel overwhelmed by the length of the form, leading to a higher abandonment rate.
Variation 2: Treatment (Two-Step Layout)

Design: Breaks the account creation process into two steps — Step 1 gathers essential information (email and password), and Step 2 gathers profile details.
Progress Indicator: A simple progress bar at the top indicates how far along users are in the signup process.
CTA Placement: The "Next" button is used after Step 1, and the "Create Account" button is presented at the end of Step 2.
Expected Outcome: A two-step process should make the signup flow feel less overwhelming, encouraging users to complete the process.

# A/B Test 3: Improve "Add Experience" Section Usability
User Story: 3

Metric: Task Completion Rate to track the number of users who successfully add all required resume sections.

##Hypothesis
Users might feel overwhelmed or uncertain when selecting specific sections (Education, Experience, Skills, Certifications) individually, leading to incomplete resumes. By consolidating the "Add Experience" actions into a single button that allows users to choose the type of content within the form, we hypothesize that users will find the process more intuitive and complete their resumes more efficiently.

##Experiment
We will allocate 50% of users to the experiment, with 25% in the control group (multiple buttons for each section) and 25% in the treatment group (single "Add Experience" button with in-form selection). This distribution ensures a statistically significant comparison without impacting overall user experience.

Firebase Capabilities Utilized

Firebase Remote Config: To toggle between multiple buttons and a single button interface.
Firebase A/B Testing: Manages the experiment and validates statistical results.
Firebase Analytics: Tracks completion rates, time spent on each section, and drop-offs, providing insights into the effectiveness of each layout.

##Variation

Variation 1: Control (Multiple Section Buttons)
Design: Users see separate buttons for "Add Education," "Add Experience," "Add Skills," and "Add Certifications."
CTA Placement: Each button directs users to its respective form.
Potential Issues: Users might experience decision fatigue or find the process less intuitive.

Variation 2: Treatment (Single "Add Experience" Button)
Design: A single "Add Experience" button directs users to a unified form where they can select the type of entry they want to add.
Expected Outcome: A consolidated approach may make the flow smoother, encouraging users to complete the resume setup with fewer drop-offs.
